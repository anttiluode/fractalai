# Fractal AI with Visualization and Interaction

## Description
This project implements an advanced Fractal AI system with dynamic growth, visualization, and interactive features. It combines concepts from fractal geometry, neural networks, and Hebbian learning to create a unique and evolving AI structure.

## Features
- Dynamic fractal network growth
- 3D visualization of the fractal AI structure
- Hebbian learning for connection weight updates
- Interactive chat functionality
- Wikipedia integration for training
- Self-conversation mode
- State saving and loading
- Zoom functionality for detailed exploration

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/anttiluode/fractalai.git
   cd fractal-ai
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script:
```
python app.py
```

This will launch a Gradio interface in your default web browser, where you can interact with the Fractal AI system.

## Interface Options

- **Run Cycles**: Execute a specified number of thinking cycles
- **Train on Wikipedia**: Input a topic to train the AI on Wikipedia content
- **Chat**: Engage in a conversation with the AI
- **Self-Conversation**: Let the AI converse with itself
- **Zoom**: Explore the fractal structure in detail
- **Save/Load State**: Preserve or restore the AI's state
